CodeIgniterTDD
==============
Setting up CodeIgniter 2.1.3 to work with PHPUnit and Netbeans to accompany my [blog post] (http://www.jamesfairhurst.co.uk/posts/view/codeigniter_phpunit_and_netbeans)

Not tested but this can probably work with older versions of CI by using the index.php as a base for the bootstrap file located in the tests folder.
